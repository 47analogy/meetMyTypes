# About Meet My Types

The organization Meet my Types was founded by Tem whose purpose is not to let people find love "whenever" but ASAP! Tem has been in business for over a year consulting with clients on helping them find their ideal love type. He's been able to help hundreds of people identify their love type and provide them with advice to find their own type based on their core behavior. Using Astrogical software he's able to provide clients with detailed information on their inner persona's so they can cut the fluff and start getting to know someone immdediately! This project is to help him expand his business from local clients in GA to clients across the US!

In addition to helping Tem achieve his goal he has allowed a group of beginner developers to work on the project to help improve their own skillset. For any developers who find this project interesting and would like to contribute and help make it fluorish we will be building it out for the duration of December 2019 - March 2020 (estimated) Let's grow and build and improve together!
